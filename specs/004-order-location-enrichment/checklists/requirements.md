# Specification Quality Checklist: Order & Location Enrichment

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-08
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows

- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Spec is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
- DataDog query patterns verified via `verify-grpc-logs.py` script - logs exist for both GetDeliveryOrder and GetLocationsDetails
- Feature builds on existing 003-log-data-export infrastructure (map-data.json export)
- Restaurant location requires location_number which should be available in trip metadata
